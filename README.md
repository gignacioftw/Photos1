# TODO
### user system:
open album (open done)
- add a tag 
- delete a tag
- (all the tag stuff should be with the tag display mode like the caption mode i made)
  
search engine
- date range
- tag based searches
- create album from search results


msg me on groupme if you have any questions its kinda cluttered not the best organized

i didnt do versioning so when you upload changes make sure to upload tje new user.dat

how should we do the tag system? it says some can have multiple and the user can create their own tag type that they can designate whether it can have multiple or just one.

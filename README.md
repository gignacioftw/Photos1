# TODO
### user system:
open album (open done)
- caption photo
- display photo in a area
- add a tag
- delete a tag
- copy photo
- move photo
- slideshow
  
search engine
- date range
- tag based searches
- create album from search results

the controllers for the user main menu is already created.
photo class i think is good might need to change the *__path variable__* to a file path?
album class should be good too.

make sure not to push your user.dat or any of the things in your data folder while testing it out. i will push the stock and admin.

how should we do the tag system? it says some can have multiple and the user can create their own tag type that they can designate whether it can have multiple or just one.

also wanna change the ui of the userhome screen.
